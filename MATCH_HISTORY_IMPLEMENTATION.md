# Match History Implementation Summary

## Overview
A match history system that maintains the last 100 matches for each player in the Waterloo-Guesser application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Database Collection: `player_matches`
- **Purpose**: Track the last 100 matches per player
- **Schema**:
  ```typescript
  interface PlayerMatchDocument {
    _id: ObjectId;
    playerId: string;          // Reference to user ObjectId
    matchId: ObjectId;         // Reference to match document
    createdAt: Date;           // When this match was completed
  }
  ```

### 2. Enhanced `/api/submitMatch` Endpoint

#### POST Method Updates:
- **New Function**: `maintainPlayerMatchHistory(db, playerId, newMatchId)`
  - Adds new match to `player_matches` collection
  - Counts total matches for the player
  - If > 100 matches, removes oldest entries
  - Maintains exactly 100 most recent matches

#### GET Method Updates:
- **Enhanced Player Query**: When retrieving by `playerId`, now uses `player_matches` collection
- **Optimized Performance**: Only queries the maintained 100 matches instead of scanning all matches
- **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing queries by `matchId` work unchanged

### 3. Updated Documentation
- **File**: `docs/api-submitMatch.md`
- **Added**: New `player_matches` collection schema
- **Updated**: GET method behavior description
- **Added**: Match history maintenance notes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Match Submission Flow:
1. Match data validated and inserted into `matches` collection
2. Player statistics updated (existing functionality)
3. Leaderboard updated (existing functionality)
4. **NEW**: Match added to `player_matches` collection
5. **NEW**: If player has > 100 matches, oldest entries are removed

### Match Retrieval Flow:
1. **By matchId**: Direct query to `matches` collection (unchanged)
2. **By playerId**: 
   - Query `player_matches` collection for recent match IDs
   - Retrieve full match data using those IDs
   - Return sorted by completion date (newest first)
3. **General query**: Direct query to `matches` collection (unchanged)

## Code Changes Made

### 1. `/app/api/submitMatch/route.ts`
- Added `maintainPlayerMatchHistory()` function
- Updated POST method to call match history maintenance
- Enhanced GET method for efficient player match retrieval
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. `/docs/api-submitMatch.md`
- Added `player_matches` collection documentation
- Updated GET method parameter descriptions
- Added notes about 100-match limit behavior

## Performance Benefits

### Before:
- Player match queries scanned entire `matches` collection
- No limit on match history, leading to growing query times
- Potential memory issues with large match histories

### After:
- Player match queries limited to 100 most recent matches
- Separate indexed collection for fast player match lookups
- Automatic cleanup maintains optimal performance
- O(1) complexity for match history maintenance

## Database Impact

### New Collection:
- `player_matches`: Lightweight reference collection
- Indexes recommended:
  - `{ playerId: 1, createdAt: -1 }` for efficient player queries
  - `{ matchId: 1 }` for cleanup operations

### Existing Collections:
- `matches`: No schema changes, continues to store full match data
- `users`: No changes to user statistics functionality
- `leaderboard`: No changes to leaderboard functionality

## Error Handling
- Match history maintenance errors don't affect core match submission
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if `player_matches` operations fail
- TypeScript type safety maintained throughout

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Database Indexes**: Add indexes for optimal query performance
2. **Batch Cleanup**: Implement background job for periodic cleanup
3. **Analytics**: Track match history usage patterns
4. **Archival**: Option to archive old matches instead of deletion

### Monitoring:
- Monitor `player_matches` collection size
- Track cleanup operation frequency
- Monitor query performance improvements

## Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing API calls work unchanged
- **Frontend Compatible**: No changes required to frontend code
- **Database Migration**: No migration needed, new collection created on first use

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- ✅ Last 100 matches maintained per player
- ✅ Oldest matches automatically removed when > 100
- ✅ Efficient retrieval using separate collection
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation updated
